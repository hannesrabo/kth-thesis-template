# About
This is a template for writing a bachelor thesis at KTH for the ICT School. It can be furter customized to fit templates for others too if anyone wants to do that.

# Example
The compiled report is included in this repo as an example. Look at [report_compiled.pdf](report_compiled.pdf).

# Usage
To compile this project, you will need to install XeLaTeX as this project is using special fonts to emulate the template from KTH. It you use regular LaTeX, it should still compile but positioning and fonts might be slightly wrong.

# Overleaf
This project works on overleaf. You will need to manually set the compiler engine to XeLaTeX in the project settings to get that option but otherwise you should just be able to zip this repo and upload it directly to overleaf. There should be a template already on Overleaf if you search for it.

# Images
The images and text belongs to KTH but has been included in this repository to make it easier to use for students. You can use this repo with images in its entirety if you are writing a thesis that you intent to turn in to KTH.

# Final Remark
Good luck writing!
