\section*{Abstract}
This is a template for writing bachelor thesis reports for the ICT school at KTH. I do not own any of the images provided in the template and this can only be used to submit thesis work for KTH.\\
The report needs to be compiled using XeLaTeX as different fonts are needed for the project to be close to the original template.\\
This template was created by Hannes Rabo <hannes.rabo@gmail.com or hrabo@kth.se> from the template provided by KTH. You can send me an email if you need support in making it work for you.
